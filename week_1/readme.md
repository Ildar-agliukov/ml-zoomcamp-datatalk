## Homework

The goal of this homework is to train a simple model for predicting the duration of a ride - similar to what we did in this module.


## Q1. Downloading the data

We'll use [the same NYC taxi dataset](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page),
but instead of "**Green** Taxi Trip Records", we'll use "**Yellow** Taxi Trip Records".

Download the data for January and February 2022.

Read the data for January. How many columns are there?
